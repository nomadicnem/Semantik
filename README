Semantik 1.0.5, Thomas Nagy tnagy at waf.io
Project page:  https://waf.io/semantik.html
Source code:   https://github.com/ita1024/semantik
-----------------------------------------------

1. Compilation and installation:

The main dependencies are Qt Webengine, KDE 5 and Python 3. Here are
a few examples for typical setups:

Ubuntu 17.10: apt install libkf5kdelibs4support-dev libqt5svg5-dev qtwebengine5-dev qtpositioning5-dev python3-dev kio-dev
Gentoo: emerge --ask kde-frameworks/kdelibs4support dev-qt/qtwebengine
Suse: zypper install python3-devel kio-devel kiconthemes-devel ki18n-devel kdelibs4support-devel libqt5-qtwebengine-devel
Fedora 27: dnf install python3-devel kf5-kio-devel kf5-kdelibs4support-devel kf5-ki18n-devel kf5-kiconthemes-devel
        gcc-c++ qt5-linguist qt5-qtsvg-devel qt5-qtwebengine-devel
FreeBSD 11: pkg add qt5-svg python36 qt5-webengine kf5-kio kf5-kdelibs4support kf5-ki18n kf5-kiconthemes

To build the project, run:
./waf configure build

A few systems may require different options such as:
PYTHON=python3 PYTHON_VERSION=3.5 waf configure build

Then run the following installation command as root (important - Semantik will only work if installed):
./waf install

The generic command for creating a package is the following (packagers):
./waf configure clean build --prefix=/usr && DESTDIR=$fakeroot ./waf install

2. Getting started:

* double-click to add an item
* when a leaf is selected, type 'enter' to start in-place editing, type 'enter' again to save
* left,right,up,down keys to navigate in the tree
* alt+left,right,up,down keys to move the selection around
* double-click on a leaf to add a ramification
* double-click on a link to disconnect

Getting started with document generators:
* look at the scripts in src/templates/
* the naming is used for finding the files

Getting started with the diagrams:
* right-click to select a component to add
* press enter to edit the properties
* use the + to start dragging a connection
* select a connection and move the points to change its dimensions

More information can be found in about->help

3. Document generators:

* Do not open documents that you have not created yourself, there are no security restrictions at the moment
* The document generation is performed in two steps: variable substitution and preprocessing
* Variables in the form @var_name@ are replaced by the corresponding document variables
* The core of the document is a variable itself
* A c-like preprocessor is then run on the resulting document, using (nested) conditionals such as:
  #if 0, #if !0, #ifdef var, #endif (the #elif construct is not supported yet)
* External viewers can be used, from the 'variables' panel, add code in the form
  'command_'+template_name=command_line, for example:

  command_html=kfmclient newTab %s
  command_odt=oowriter %s
  command_s5=firefox %s

  this is only necessary for documents that do not have a KDE mapping for opening them
* LaTeX commands can be inserted by using all_latex=1

It is also possible to export maps from the command-line (png or pdf):
semantik foo.sem -o foo.pdf

Diagrams can be exported in a similar fashion:
semantik-d diag.semd -o foo.pdf

5. Quirks:

If you are getting screen artifacts when dragging and selecting elements,
try changing the QtCurve Qt widget style to Breeze for example (Ubuntu 17.10).
